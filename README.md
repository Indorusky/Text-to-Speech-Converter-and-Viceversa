# Text-to-Speech-Converter-and-Viceversa
This project is a real-time Speech ↔ Text web application built with FastAPI, browser-based Speech Recognition, and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). Users can speak in multiple languages and see their words appear as text in the browser, and also convert typed text back into natural-sounding speech.
